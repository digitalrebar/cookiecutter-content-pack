# Digital Rebar Cookie Cutter Content Pack

In this cookiecutter you will find a basic content pack that can be used to get your custom content organized correctly.


## Usage

With cookiecutter installed

    cookiecutter gh:digitalrebar/cookiecutter-content-pack


## Notes

This content pack only has the folder structure and all required meta files. There is no actual content. 
Be sure to check out [our example content pack](https://github.com/digitalrebar/colordemo) for details on 
making your own content.

This cookiecutter will also generate directories you may not want to use in your content pack. Be sure to remove 
ones you do not plan to use. An empty directory will cause the content bundle command to fail.
